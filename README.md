# Design and Analysis of Algorithm Programs Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to the Design and Analysis of Algorithm Programs repository! This repository contains a collection of programs implemented in C language, focusing on various algorithms. These programs are developed as part of academic coursework or personal projects to explore different algorithmic techniques and their efficiencies.

## Content
The repository includes implementations of algorithms such as:
- Sorting algorithms (e.g., Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort)
- Searching algorithms (e.g., Linear Search, Binary Search)
- Graph algorithms (e.g., Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm)
- Dynamic programming algorithms (e.g., Knapsack Problem, Longest Common Subsequence)

Each algorithm is implemented in C language and accompanied by documentation explaining its functionality, time complexity analysis, and usage instructions.

## Usage
To utilize the programs in this repository, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/design-analysis-algorithms.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the directory containing the desired algorithm implementation.
3. Compile the C program using an appropriate compiler (e.g., GCC):
   ```
   gcc -o program_name program_name.c
   ```
4. Run the compiled executable to execute the algorithm:
   ```
   ./program_name
   ```

## Contribution
Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have an algorithm implementation in C language that you would like to add or have found a bug in existing code, feel free to open a pull request. Please ensure that your contributions adhere to the repository's coding standards and include appropriate documentation.
